# Archival and retrieval

COSMA has a powerful archiving system, used to transfer old data to tape. Once on tape, archives can be restored to disk, if necessary.

We can archive directories upon request. Eventually, there will be a graphical and command line tool to choose directories for archival or restoration.

Please note that while tape storage is long-term, the duration is not infinite (due mainly to hardware upgrades) and so you should regularly check that your data is still there, or move it to the newest tape archive system if new hardware has been purchased.
