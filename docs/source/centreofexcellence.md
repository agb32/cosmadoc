# Centres of Excellence

COSMA is a Centre of Excellence in several areas

## Dell

In 2021, COSMA became a Dell Centre of Excellence (CoE) for HPC and AI.

The focus of the CoE is on:

- Use of SmartNICs/DPUs in HPC for communications protocol offloads
- Evaluation of high-speed, low-latency Ethernet technologies
- Implementation of reconfigurable or composable architectures for HPC infrastructure

## CerIO

In 2022, COSMA became a CoE for Rockport (now CerIO) focusing on advanced network fabrics.

The focus of the CoE is on:

- Evaluation of new network technologies
- Lab and production-scale network testbeds
- Evaluation of composable clusters

As part of this CoE we have deployed a production 6D Torus network on COSMA7, and a composable infrastructure system.
