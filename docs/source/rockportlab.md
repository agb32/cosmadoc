# Rockport lab

The Rockport cluster is a 224 node production cluster equipped with a 100G 6D torus low latency Ethernet fabric.

[Usage instructions](rockport.md) are available.

## History

A 16-node prototype Rockport fabric was installed in 2021.  The success of this system led to the need to test at scale, and in 2022 half of the COSMA7 system was converted to Rockport, allowing a direct performance comparison between Rockport and a traditional Ethernet fabric

## Funding

This system is funded by ExCALIBUR and DiRAC
