# Durham solar panel installation

In 2023, a large solar panel installation was installed at Durham University to power the DiRAC facility, and is expected to provide around 7% of COSMA's annual energy needs.

The funding behind this scheme was aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from UK Digital Research Infrastructure, and to provide a case study for UKRI-funded solar panel installation on university estates in short time periods.

The solar panels went live for DiRAC in April 2024, with 80% of the energy generated dedicated to DiRAC for a period of over 10 years.
