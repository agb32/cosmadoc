Apols - Stephen, Peter.


- PAX plan for phase 1b
        - track record
        - Outline for the work packages
                - What am I missing?
    - Updates
        - Peter D
        - Abouzied
    - what next for Parallel in time
    

Update - Abouzied - realigning the structs to make more efficient for
GPUs.  Pointer chasing more problematic for GPUs.
Small speedup shown, but much potential because the kernels themselves
are very fast, on a low-ish-end GPU.

Finding regular patterns should be part of the bid.

Fusing these kernels - do we know which other DSL projects have been
funded.

What to do in phase 1B:
2 FTEs for 3 years (6 total).

Start from engineering position and build up what is needed.

Task engines - quick sched, work with openMP.  But many things we need
to include.  Execute tasks on CPU and GPU.

DSL idea of graphs.

OneAPI - specify task graphs and have it generate.

Task execution work package

Abstraction work package - Matthieu surprisingly positive.

Domain specific language - are there applications that work in real
life?  The fireDrake project with Pheonix would be an example.  Write
down a PDE, press a button and get a solution.  Wonderfully flexible
but may only solve a toy problem.  

Networking hardware.

GPU v CPU balance

Co-design

Affecting standards (ieee etc).

Communications - following on from Peter.  Optimised data exchange.

Code coupling project - need to leave the door open for this.
