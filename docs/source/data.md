# Data Transfer

Data transfer off-site can be done from one of the login nodes (10GBit/s connectivity or from dataweb.cosma.dur.ac.uk (20GBit/s bonded). Alternatively, a GLOBUS ONLINE account can be used (which is associated with dataweb). Various other fast copy tools are available, such as bbcp (module load bbcp).

## GLOBUS Online

To use GLOBUS, you first need to visit [globus.org](globus.org) and sign in. Here, don't select the organisation, but use a Globus ID. If you don't have an account, create one. Then, select cosma#dataweb as an end point. From there, you will be able to transfer your files. If you do not know your COSMA password, please email cosma-support@durham,ac.uk, to have it reset.

To transfer files, it is necessary to explicitly allow access to your directory of interest. Please contact cosma-support@durham.ac.uk to allow this.
