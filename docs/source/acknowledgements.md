# Acknowledgements

Please include the appropriate standard wording below, as appropriate, in the acknowledgements of all papers that make use of the Durham DiRAC facility.

Papers without an acknowledgement will not be counted as DiRAC papers. It is becoming increasingly important that we can demonstrate how productive the DiRAC facilities are when applying for future HPC systems, so we need every paper to count.

## New Wording (2018 onwards)

The new wording applies for any publication that has used DiRAC (even partially) from 1st May 2018.

For Durham we have two versions:

(1) general DiRAC users

(2) specifically for local Durham users (hpcicc) and Virgo (dp004) users - the acknowledgement includes an additional grant code

The wording is reproduced below between the pairs of dashed lines.

Please be careful to use the correct one.

__(1) DiRAC@Durham (Memory Intensive service) for all RAC projects *EXCEPT* dp004, dp203 (Virgo) and hpcicc(Durham COSMA5 users)__

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This work used the DiRAC@Durham facility managed by the Institute for Computational Cosmology on behalf of the STFC DiRAC HPC Facility (www.dirac.ac.uk). The equipment was funded by BEIS capital funding via STFC capital grants ST/P002293/1, ST/R002371/1 and ST/S002502/1, Durham University and STFC operations grant ST/R000832/1. DiRAC is part of the National e-Infrastructure. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

__(2) DiRAC@Durham (Memory Intensive service) for Virgo (dp004, dp203) and Durham (hpcicc) users__

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This work used the DiRAC@Durham facility managed by the Institute for Computational Cosmology on behalf of the STFC DiRAC HPC Facility (www.dirac.ac.uk). The equipment was funded by BEIS capital funding via STFC capital grants ST/K00042X/1, ST/P002293/1, ST/R002371/1 and ST/S002502/1, Durham University and STFC operations grant ST/R000832/1. DiRAC is part of the National e-Infrastructure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Variations on the text are acceptable with good reason - such as when there are severe space limits, or because more than one DiRAC facility was used. Please make sure the acknowledgement has 'DiRAC', 'Durham' and the grant numbers as a minimum so the paper can be found easily by a text search on ADS.

For info, the acknowledgements of all of the DiRAC facilities can be found [here](https://dirac.ac.uk/community/#Acknowledgements).

## Prior to 2018

For users at Durham and/or members of Virgo Consortium please state the following:

*"This work used the DiRAC Data Centric system at Durham University, operated by the Institute for Computational Cosmology on behalf of the STFC DiRAC HPC Facility (www.dirac.ac.uk). This equipment was funded by BIS National E-infrastructure capital grant ST/K00042X/1, STFC capital grant ST/H008519/1, and STFC DiRAC Operations grant ST/K003267/1 and Durham University. DiRAC is part of the National E-Infrastructure."*


For everyone else:

*"This work used the COSMA Data Centric system at Durham University, operated by the Institute for Computational Cosmology on behalf of the STFC DiRAC HPC Facility (www.dirac.ac.uk. This equipment was funded by a BIS National E-infrastructure capital grant ST/K00042X/1, DiRAC Operations grant ST/K003267/1 and Durham University. DiRAC is part of the National E-Infrastructure."*

Thank you for your cooperation.
