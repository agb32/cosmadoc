# Composability

COSMA has two composable systems to allow experimentation with composability, i.e. the ability to define server components within software.

## Liqid system

A Liqid system installed in 2021 has 4 nodes (including a login node) to which both GPU and RAM can be composed upon demand.

## CerIO system

A [CerIO](cerio.md) system installed in 2024 has 8 nodes which share 8 GPUs, allowing servers with up to 8 GPUs to be configured.  Follow the [instructions](cerio.md) to use this system.
