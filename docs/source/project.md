# Project codes

To apply for an account for COSMA on [SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/dirac) you will need a project code.

## DiRAC RAC projects

If you are part of a DiRAC project that has been awarded time as part of the usual Resource Allocation Committee (RAC) process, you will have an account code in the form dpXXX (where XXX is a 3 digit number).

You should make sure that the PI of the project knows who you are as they will have to authorise your account.
