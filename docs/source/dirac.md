[DiRAC](https://dirac.ac.uk) provides HPC facilities for the STFC
theory community and is managed and funded by STFC. DiRAC is the
integrated supercomputing facility for theoretical modelling and
HPC-based research in particle physics, astronomy and cosmology, areas
in which the UK is world-leading. The COSMA7 and COSMA8 systems are
DiRAC nodes, hosted and operated by Durham University. DiRAC HPC
facilities exist at these sites:
- Cambridge University
- Durham University
- Edinburgh University
- Leicester University


In 2009, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) received
£12.32 milllion, from the Government's Large Facilities Capital Fund
to invest in new hardware to provide UK particle physics and
astronomers with upgraded HPC technology to address some of the most
challenging scientific problems. In 2011, DiRAC received an additional
£15 million from government (DiRAC II), together with a contribution
towards operating costs from STFC. In 2018, additional money was also
received for DiRAC 2.5x, and in 2020, the initial funding for DiRAC-3,
£20m, was received, topped up by further funding (£10m) in 2022.

DiRAC provides a variety of computer architectures, matching machine
architecture to the algorithm design and requirements of the research
problems to be solved. There are sound scientific reasons for this
choice which was adopted as a philosophy following a number of
in-depth reviews involving the research community which gave detailed
advice on the nature and balance of resources required by the STFC
research community. The demands of the different research domains
supported by STFC are such that a distributed installation was the
most cost effective way to satisfy the varied scientific requirements.

## COSMA: The DiRAC Memory Intensive System

The Durham system, COSMA, is memory intensive, with lots of memory per
compute core (currently 18GB for COSMA7, and 8GB for COSMA5 and
8). It is therefore ideal for large cosmological simulations.

As a single Facility, DiRAC allows more effective and efficient use of
equipment, promotes the science goals of the STFC communities,
provides a common training and consultation framework and, crucially,
provides critical mass and a coordinating structure for both small and
large scale cross-discipline science projects, the technical support
needed to run and develop a distributed HPC service, and potential
knowledge transfer and industrial partnership projects. The continued
pooling of complementary expertise will ensure that the UK remains one
of the world-leaders of theoretical modeling in particle physics,
astronomy and cosmology.
