# Immersion cooling laboratory

The Durham Immersion Cooling Laboratory, part of the Hardware Lab, and funded by the [ICHS project](https://durham.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ichs/index.html) will provide access to immersion cooling technologies for HPC technical support teams from across the UK.

This facility will host the renewed COSMA5 HPC system, and aim to reduce the entry barrier to this technology.
