# Industry and Cosma

We welcome proposals from Industry, and other external users, to use COSMA. We take a collaborative approach: we allow you to use COSMA facilities at very competitive cost, while COSMA/DiRAC benefit from industrial engagement.

We also welcome proposals for joint hardware studies, and investigations of HPC technologies.

In the first instance, please contact Alastair Basden, a.g.basden@durham.ac.uk
