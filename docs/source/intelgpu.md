# Intel GPU Testbeds

COSMA has a Sapphire Rapids based node with 2x Intel Ponte Vecchio Data Centre GPUs.  This allows code devleopment, porting and performance benchmarking.

The `xpu-smi` command can be used to see the details, and a sycl compiler is available from OneAPI (`module load intel_comp`).

More information is given on the [GPU pages](gpu.md).
