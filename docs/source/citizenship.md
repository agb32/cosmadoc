# Good citizenship guide

- Please remember that login nodes are a shared resource
  - Interactive jobs
  - Testing
  - Compilation
  - Post-analysis

- Please do not run interactive jobs on batch queues unless essential
  - in which case please do not let them remain idle
    - Idle jobs in queues waste precious compute time

- Please do not run long non-interactive jobs on login nodes
  - for more than a few seconds
  - These are better submitted to the queues

- Please do not run jobs that will hog memory on login nodes

- Do not share your account details with anyone else
  - They should apply for their own account

- Follow common sense
  - Do not use COSMA as a VPN
  - Do not attempt to use sudo
  - Do not install dodgy or malicious software
  - Do not try to circumvent any software licences
  - Do not run unlicenced or illegal software
  - Only use COSMA for your authorised scientific workloads

- If you see problems, please let us know

There are some [policies](policies.md) which should be adhered to.
