# GitLab

COSMA has a GitLab instance for hosting code repositories. You can access it [here](https://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk).

## Set up an account

Please contact cosma-support@durham.ac.uk if you wish to set up an account.

## Using GitLab

There is a thorough, step-by-step to git and all other GitLab features [here](https://docs.gitlab.com).

To use GitLab, you will need an SSH keypair (like the one you generated during [SSH setup](ssh.md)).

Please do not store large binary files in the COSMA gitlab, as it is not backed by a large storage volume.
